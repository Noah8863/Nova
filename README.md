# Nova National

This is a front-end-only eCommerce website created for a local business called "Nova International". This company specializes in whole selling medical/sanitary flooring and countertop. The project was worked on over the course of a few weeks with the help of my designer, Tess Welch. We were in contact with the client through Google Docs, Trello, and Zoom and used additional tools like Google Drive, Canva, and VS-Code.
